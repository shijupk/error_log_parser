With the SCSP3, this message does not appear.
Cause This is an ESB bus error on one side.
Action SSB401, SEC402/SEC401 or ESB bus failure may be considered as an error
cause. Take appropriate action in the following:
• Check to see if the ESB bus cables are connected correctly. Check for incorrect
connection or bad connection of the cables, or check the terminators
of the bus.
• Check to see if one SSB401 is causing a bus error of the entire buses according
to the following procedure.
Pull out the ESB bus connector of each SSB401 that connects to the corresponding
bus, one by one, from the node.
Wait for two to three seconds, and if “Recover” is not printed, insert the
ESB bus connector again, and pull the bus connector of the next node.
If “Recover” is printed, the bus connector of the SSB401 that was pull out
at that time is faulty, so replace the SSB401.
• If no recovery was made even after the bus connectors of all nodes were
pulled out, the SEC402/SEC401 may be faulty. In such a case, replace
the SEC402/SEC401.

• If no recovery was still made, press the [START/STOP] button on the
CPU module’s front panel on the control side twice, and switch the control
right of the CPU module. Replace the CPU module after restarting.
If the bus does not recover even after these operations, the error may be related
to the ESB bus cable (T-shape connector and so on). Replace the ESB
bus cable.
Note This message is generated if all safety node units become abnormal.
This message is also generated if all safety node units become abnormal in a
system configuration that includes the Optical ESB Bus Repeater module.
However, if all safety node units directly connected to SEC402/SEC401 without
going through the Optical Repeater module become abnormal in this system
configuration, this message is not generated so long as any safety node

Printing example 1 SCS0101 NBS Fail N-IO NODE 02 NBS RIGHT
Meaning 1 An error occurred in an N-ESB bus module (S2EN501) (right side in the above
example) of an N-IO node (2 in the above example) of the safety control station
(station name = SCS0101).
Cause 1 One of the following causes may be considered.
• N-ESB bus module is faulty.
• Connection route to the N-ESB bus module has problem.
• For the N-I/O nodes that are connected via Optical ESB Bus Repeater
modules, the Optical ESB Bus Repeater module related hardware such
as ESB Bus Repeater module or Fiber-optic cable is faulty.
Action 1 Replace the N-ESB bus module and check to see if the problem is resolved. If
not, other locations may be abnormal. If all N-IO nodes connected to the NESB
bus of the same system are abnormal, the N-ESB bus coupler module or
N-ESB bus cable may be faulty. If all the N-IO nodes routed through the Optical
ESB Bus Repeater related devices become abnormal, the Optical ESB
Bus Repeater module or Fiber-optic cable may be faulty. Moreover, if the Optical
ESB Bus Repeater modules are mounted in the SNT10D, the error may be
caused by the failure of a power supply module of SNT10D unit. Identify the
abnormal location from the message, LED ON status, etc., and replace the applicable
device.
Printing example 2 SCS0101 SBS Fail FIO NODE 02 SBS RIGHT
Meaning 2 An error occurred in an ESB Bus Interface module (right side in the above example)
of an FIO node (2 in the above example) of the safety control station

Cause 2 One of the following causes may be considered.
• ESB Bus Interface module becomes abnormal.
• Connection route to the ESB Bus Interface module becomes abnormal.
• For the safety node units that are connected via Optical ESB Bus Repeater
modules, the Optical ESB Bus Repeater related module related hardware
(Optical ESB Bus Repeater module, Fiber-optic cable, etc.) is faulty.
Action 2 If no ESB bus error message is output, the ESB Bus Interface module may be
faulty. Replace the applicable ESB Bus Interface module. If all the safety node
units routed through the Optical ESB Bus Repeater related devices become
abnormal and all the safety node units routed through such Optical Repeater
become abnormal, error may have occurred in the Optical ESB Bus Repeater
module or Fiber-optic cable. Moreover, if the Optical ESB Bus Repeater modules
are mounted in the SNT10D, the error may be caused by the failure of a
power supply module of SNT10D unit. Identify the abnormal location from the
message, LED ON status, etc., and replace the applicable device.
If all nodes connected to the SCSP3 (except for the N-IO nodes connected via
the N-ESB bus) are abnormal, the ESB Bus Interface module (SSB401), ESB
bus coupler module (SEC402/SEC401) or ESB bus may be faulty. Execute the

Message name Communication error when acquiring HART device status (No response)
Printing example SCS0101 HART NODE 01 UNIT 01 SLOT 01 CH 01 Device Status Communication
Error (No Response) Device=0123456789
Meaning When acquiring the status of the HART device (device ID = 0123456789) that
is connected to channel 1 of the I/O module installed in slot 1 of unit 1 of N-IO
node 1 of the safety control station (station name = SCS0101), no response
(time-out) occurred in the communication between the HART device and the
analog digital I/O module.
Cause No response is received from the HART device due to one of the following
causes:
• Disconnected cable
• Effect of noise
<3.4 Fieldbus Messages (Message Numbers 3401 through 3408)> 3-29
IM 32P02B10-01EN 6th Edition : Dec.20,2019-00
• The range of the received signal is low.
• Output current from the analog digital I/O module is outside the HART
communication enable range supported by the HART device.
Action Check the HART device, communication route between the HART device and
analog digital I/O module, or I/O parameter settings (tight shut/full open output
settings, etc.)
Remarks If no problem is found in the communication route from the HART device to the
analog digital I/O module, the HART circuit in the analog digital I/O module
may be faulty. Depending on the faulty location in the HART circuit, the control
right over the analog digital I/O module may not switch even in a redundant
configuration. In this case, switch the module control right by using the IOM
control right switching tool and check if the communication recovers. If the
communication recovered to normal, the HART circuit in the standby module is
likely faulty, so replace the module.
